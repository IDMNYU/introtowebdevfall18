## Day 18

* Learning Log: Shahriar--rescheduled for Thursday

* Homework Review/Questions

### In Class/Homework JS DOM Manipulation Practice:

    *This is an exercise to gain more practice with events in Javascript.*

Begin by creating an HTML document that has at least 10 of the same HTML elements.

Wrap some of these inside of < div > tags. Assign an ID to at least two of your < div > tags.

Build three buttons that will run a function on click.

Now, create at least three functions that will return the following with an alert on click:

How many of the same HTML elements are on the page. (For example, if you included 10 < p > tags, it should return a statement that says something about there being 10 < p > tags.)
How many elements are inside of your first ID
How many elements are inside of your second ID
If you have additional IDs on the page, you may include additional click events.

Submission: 

Push your project folder to Github Pages, and submit the links to your source code and live code via NYU Classes under Assignment #9.
