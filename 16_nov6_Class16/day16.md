### Let's talk about voting

* If you are registered to vote in New York, VOTE TODAY

* If you are registered in another state, I hope you filed an absentee ballot.

* If you are not able to vote in the U.S., you are still effected by the policies the government makes. 

* What you can do now:

    * GO TO YOUR VOTING PLACE AND VOTE
    
    * Find 2 other people at IDM who are registered to vote in NY but have not yet cast their vote.
    
    * Call 2 friends or relatives in other states and remind them to vote.
    
    * If you can prove you engaged in any of this activity, I will give you a free extension of one class period on any assignment. (This applies to old assignments and upcoming assignments.)
