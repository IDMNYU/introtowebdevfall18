### Homework

* If you are unclear about git, Github or anything related to this version control process, I highly recommend you do a Learning Log on the topic you need the most clarity on. It will be important for you to understand how to push code to Github for documentation purposes in this class.

* Want some additional reading on Github? [Awesome. Here you go.](http://mjwebster.github.io/DataJ/tipsheets/GitHubTutorial.pdf)
